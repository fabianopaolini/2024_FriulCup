#258: Created a more general solution for team scoring: Make it possible to, for example, score only the 2nd and 3rd pilot in a team
#259: Fixed a bug where under certain conditions a pilot's nation information was lost while editing that pilot's data
#260: Fixed a bug where pilots who did not reach SSS always received minimum distance, even if they flew further
#263: Fixed a bug where if a pilot's flight information was set manually (DF), the maximum altitude was set to a large negative number
#264: Fixed a bug where setting a flight manually (DF) in Open Distance tasks produced an error message and did not work
#265: Fixed a bug where if waypoints using the naming format xxx-yy produce an error message when editing tasks
#266: Allow importing IGC trackfiles besides KML files
#267: Fixed a bug where the results output in HTML did not always display the line currently under the mouse pointer in yellow in Internet Explorer
- Update GpsDump to version 4.77

FS2013
------
- Event view: Select whether competition is hang gliding or paragliding - affects presets of GAP technical parameters
- Formula picker: Enable double click to select a formula
- Formula editor: Separate GAP parameters from technical, "advanced" parameters, in two screens. Allow pre-setting the 
  technical parameters for GAP2000, OzGAP2005 or GAP2013, and also for PG or HG comps.
- Implemented GAP2013 formula. Just for naming consitency, no changes since 2012.
- Implemented PWC2013 formula. Difference to GAP2013: Launch validity; distance points are awarded linearly, no more 
  difficulty evaluation; stopped tasks with fixed score-back time; stopped-task-validity; in stopped tasks, pilots
  between ESS and goal are scored for complete flight; in stopped tasks time-points for pilots making goal are reduced 
  by the amount of points a pilot would have gotten if he'd crossed ESS at exactly the stop time; if goal and ESS are 
  identical, calculate and award altitude arrival points.
- Task view: Double Click on Task to edit task.
- Task view: Enabled user ordering of task participant columns 
- Task view: Enabled user width change of task participant columns 
- Task view: Added the following columns to Task Participants list: Speed (populated for pilots who have finished SS),
  Distance Points, Time Points, Arrival Points, Departure Points, Leading Points, Total Points Rank
- Task edit view: Moved goal altitude, is now always enabled, gets pre-populated if last turnpoint follows the NNNAAA 
  format
- Task edit view: Depending on formula, score-back-time can be pre-populated and is not editable in that case. 
  E.g. PWC2013 sets this to a fixed 5 minutes (as opposed to GAP).
- Flight view: Fix bug in flight information output (wrong information displayed, bad formatting)
- Update GpsDump to version 4.76

1.3.4
-----
- Fixed bug where cylinder crossings were not always recognized correctly (introduced in 1.3.3)

1.3.3
-----
- Fixed bug where cylinder crossings were not always recognized correctly (introduced in 1.3.2)

1.3.2
-----
- Fixed bug where if a pilot did not reach the first turnpoint after SSS, the start time was miscalculated (first time they crossed the cylinder instead of last time)

1.3.1
-----
- Ticket #10: Add and delete buttons for turn points in task setup window
- Ticket #55: Show both turn point names and descriptions in task setup window
- Ticket #150: Simplified search for participant details in CIVL database
- Adjusted GAP2011 to reflect rule changes made by the 2012 Plenary: Jump the Gun for Hang Gliding competitions
- Fixed bug where in stopped tasks, the complete track until landing was considered for leading points calculation
